    A standalone application intended for batch reviewing replays and

    For instance, you may want to go through the top 50 scores on a map and
    assign a "cursordance score" to them, depending on how often the user
    cursordanced.

    To do so, you could assign the number keys 0-9 to a score from 1 to 10 via
    ``hotkeys`` and give ``Classifier`` the list of replays you want to
    classify. ``Classifier`` will visualize the scores, one at a time, in order.
    When you've decided on a score for the replay, hit the corresponding number
    button, and have your function call ``self.next_replay`` to show the next
    replay in order to you.
